`streamToTab.groovy`: a groovy script to convert source data for CHS Homer Commentary from streaming format to tabular (`.csv`) format.  Commentary entries are written to standard output.  A test file is included at `test/test-in.txt`.  Running the script with this file should generate 12 lines of `.csv` output.
