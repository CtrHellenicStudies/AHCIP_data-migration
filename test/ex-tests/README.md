** Tests of using Ryan's regexes with ex / vim **

    This directory comprises my tests of whether ex provided with vim
    works with Ryan's regexes. (It does).

    Some of the stuff here might be useful to create an automated bash
    script to process files that are in CSV format after Phase 1
    processing (output from ../test-phase1 and the Groovy script on
    the stream files). It is barely started.
