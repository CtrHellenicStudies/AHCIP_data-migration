** Tests of using Ryan's regexes with ex / vim **

    This directory comprises my tests of whether ex provided with vim
    works with Ryan's regexes. (It does).

    Some of the stuff here might be useful to create an automated bash
    script to process files that are in CSV format after Phase 1
    processing (output from ../test-phase1 and the Groovy script on
    the stream files). It is barely started.

hn-hh-refs.ex		- regex file (incomplete) where I was trying

                          lines

set-source-urn.ex       - regex file (incomplete/imperfect) that would convert
                          all references in the first column of input
			  to the CTS URN for that passage.
